Application Based Queries:

1)Application → For environmental concerns.
  a) Traveller to capacity ratio for every flight.

SELECT F.FLIGHTCODE,CAST(COUNT(B.VALIDID) as float)/CAST(A.capacity as float)*100 AS Percentage_Ratio FROM BOOKS AS B JOIN TICKETS AS TCK ON B.JOURNEYID=TCK.JOURNEYID JOIN FLIGHT AS F ON TCK.FLIGHTCODE=F.FLIGHTCODE
JOIN AIRCRAFT AS A ON F.AIRCRAFTID=A.AIRCRAFTID GROUP BY F.FLIGHTCODE,A.AIRCRAFTID ORDER BY Percentage_Ratio DESC;

-> This query tells us which flight has a high/low capacity ratio. It is an environmental concern if this ratio is low as most of the seats are empty while the amount of fuel used is the same.


  b) Total material used in surface construction across all runaways.

SELECT * FROM RUNWAY GROUP BY SURFACETYPE 
ORDER BY SUM(WIDTH*LENGTH) AS AREA;

-> Asphalt is more hazardous to the environment when compared to concrete as it releases harmful chemicals which causes air pollution. It is a concern if it is overused.
